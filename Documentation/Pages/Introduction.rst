What does it do?
================

The target audience is developers looking to expose a REST API from their respective extensions.

This extension gives the possibility of using `Luracast Restler <https://github.com/Luracast/Restler/tree/v3>`_ in TYPO3.
It provides the basis for using REST in your own extensions acting like a wrapper.

You can configure endpoints to be available via normal HTTP methods or using internal REST-like PHP calls.
